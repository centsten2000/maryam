							<a href="booking.html" class="highlight-text"> My booking form is here, </a> I generally don’t close it unless in extremely busy or in unprecedented circumstances.

						<div class="question">
							Will you be travelling? How can I get you to come to my city?		
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							I love travelling! Feel free to shoot me a short email requesting it.

						<div class="question">
							Do you do underage tattoos?	
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							No, sorry. 18+ only.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-group">
						<div class="question">
							How much do you charge?	
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							I generally charge by the hour, which is currently $135 per hour. It also depends how big you want the tattoo, where you want it and how complex the design is. I will charge more if there is colour involved in the design, and more for custom designs. 

							For clients with proven financial needs, I offer staggered payment plans. For clients who request a trauma related tattoo, such as a scar cover up, I can reduce the price. Furthermore, if you have been a ward of the state (foster kid) I offer reduced pricing. If you can pay full price, that is great, since it covers the cost for those who cannot.

					<div class="question-group">
						<div class="question">
							Are you interesting in trading?	
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							Maybe! Generally not for other tattoos, but let me know if you have an interesting angle and I’ll consider it.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-group">
						<div class="question">
							Will you tattoo this drawing I did? What about this drawing my friend made?				
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							I prefer to tattoo my own designs but maybe if I vibe with it! If I like it, I’ll probably even ask if I can give it my own interpretation.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-group">
						<div class="question">
							Can you fix this old tattoo I have, or give me a cover up?	
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							I’ll likely say no, since it’s best to take up these issues with the original artist but you never know! A good way to get me to consider a cover up, or fixing an old tattoo, is to book a new tattoo with me. That way, it’s easy for me to go in and attend to any other old tattoos that may need some TLC.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-group">
						<div class="question">
							When can I touch up my tattoo you gave me?	
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							Ideally in the next 6 months after I gave it to you! Touch-ups are always free.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-group">
						<div class="question">
							Can you show me the tattoo design before I commit to it?
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							Generally not, sorry. Due to a busy schedule, I draw my designs right before the appointment. Please make sure you trust my artistic sensibility and look over my work carefully before you commit to a piece from me. That being said, I definitely recommend consultations a few weeks in advance, especially for larger works, so we can be on the same page. Consultations can be done via skype or zoom as well.

							If you are unsure of the drawing I have for you when you come in for your appointment, please let me know! It’s in my best interest to know exactly what you want so you can be happy with your forever ink!
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="question-group">
						<div class="question">
							I’m pumped for my appointment! How can I prepare?	
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							Please arrive well rested, well hydrated, ideally with a snack. If you know that you have dry skin, it doesn’t hurt to moisturize the area once a day, a couple of days before your appointment. Please wear appropriate clothing (dark colours) to reveal the area I will be working on.

							Pain varies for each person, by body part. In general, the more painful areas of the body to tattoo are the more bony ones (ribs, back, knee, etc.) and also the parts that are less exposed (inside of arm, inside of thigh, etc.) However, everyone’s pain tolerance is different – in accordance with the type of design you are getting tattooed. I specialize in fine, thin lines, but there are designs that involve thicker lines and blackouts. If you think you will have an issue with pain, please consider a topical numbing cream, such as zenza.
